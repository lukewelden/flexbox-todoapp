# Flexbox: To-Do App
This project comes from the *Making a Website Responsive* unit which is part of Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Path. 
It demonstrates my knowledge of using CSS's flexbox to make a web app more responsive. 

> In this project, you will follow step-by-step instructions to fix a to-do web app. All of the HTML and most of the CSS is intact, however, a few Flexbox values are missing. In order to complete this project, you must know how to set an element’s Flexbox properties. We recommend that you review our Flexbox Lesson before beginning. The website’s existing index.html and style.css files are displayed in the text editor to the right. Good luck!

## Tasks 
[x] Start off by turning the elements with the class`container` and `square` into flex containers and the elements with a class `week` and `reminders` into inline-flex containers. 
[x] The elements inside the new inline flex containers should grow to fill the container. 
[x] We want the flex items with the class `week` to be ordered vertically instead of horizontally. 
[x] The items with the class `row` should move to the next line when the container gets too small. 
[x] The items with the class `row` also need some space between them. 
[x] Lastly, the elements with the class `row` and elements with the class `square` need to be aligned vertically.
